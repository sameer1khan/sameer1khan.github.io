        "text": "<p>During the experiment, <a href=\"https://ibb.co/G7ySf63\">beacons on barrels</a> were uniformly arranged <b>x</b> m apart along the workzone boundary in the simulator's virtual environment. Each subsequent beacon was initialized to flash off-on-off with a span of <b>t</b> s with respect to ground. This created an apparant wave pattern among the strobing light devices directed towards the oncoming vechicle (observer). None of the participants reported noticing the runway lights like pattern directed towards them in their exit survey. Each participant confirmed seeing a glowing <a href=\"https://ibb.co/dPkvPZV\">beacon on the traffic barrels</a> demarkating only one workzone - the static light condition workzone. \n\n<p>The particular wavelength or color of light from the virtual reality beacons was designed to be as close as possible to amber color of sodium vapor lamp warning beacons used as traffic control devices in North America and the UK. For the model however, the physical parameter of light's wavelength while passing through air, fog, car windshield and human eye was taken as a scalar \"unit\". This scalar quantity of 1 was appropriate for the model to account for the incident light on the driver's eyes as the \"unit interaction layer\" of electromagnetic spectrum suitably coupled to or entangled with their naked or aided human eye. Thus, in an abstract sense, each impinging spherical waveform, with its idiosyncrasies, couples to the optical sensor at unit area of incidence or cross section or hyperplane, along each conceivalbe dimensionality. The image on this page depicts projection of those hyperplanes from 4D of space and 0D of time into a convention of 3D of space and 1D of time. Coincidentally, identical visualizations are achieved when modeling thermodinamics of energy transductions or momenta transferences as well as communication of any <i>message, medium and mode</i> between a sender and a recipient. \n\n<p>Conjoined effects of spacetime curvature and eyebal curvature was approximated as height of drivers' eyes above ground level denoted by <b>N</b>. It was taken as an average height of 1.6 m for adult dirvers in a sedan. This serendipitously worked out very well for the model.  "

Inducing a belief of moving at a much slower speed than the car's actual speed was also demonstrable. The word \"actual\" is used here in the context of the simulator's build. \n<p>The induced belief (and possibly subsequent change to assumed risk of conceived speed) had systematic correlations with drivers' actions in using break and accelerator pedals to maintain the car's actual driving speed. The outcome was that driving speed across almost all test participants was brought within the culturally prescribed range without the use of obtrusive signage, speed humps, police vehicles etc. in the simulator.   \n<p>(Zoom into image to see details) "
